# Content Management

Content Management allows detection engineers to seamlessly deploy content (policies and parsers) in their environment. The Securonix content team has a content library where they upload new and modified content to share with customers. Customers have their own local content repository in the file system located at "$SECURONIX_HOME/content/data". Content administrators or detection engineers can efficiently download new and updated content, and deploy it in their SNYPR application. The following types of content can be deployed using Content Management:

* Parsers
* Third Party Intelligence
* Data Dictionary
* Active List
* Lookup Tables
* Workflow
* Policy
* Threat Models

## Example

```tpl
{{</* section */>}}
```

{{<section>}}
