# Data Dictionary

Data Dictionary simplifies the ingestion, analytics, and hunting processes by providing consistent and easy to understand labels for data ingested from various datasources. These labels provide uniformity to data ingested from multiple datasources within a functionality.

Content developers can use these mapped labels to create policies that can be used for multiple datasources. This reduces the time and effort a content developer has to spend on creating policies for different datasources. The unified labels help security analysts to get valuable context and query data efficiently in Spotter.
